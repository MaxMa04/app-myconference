# Conference Mobile App

Fully featured conference app built with .NET MAUI powered by Sessionize.

At the time of writing I don't have a fully etched out plan yet, so stay tuned and feel free to pitch in with ideas or PRs!

## Using this app for your event

Great that you're using this app for your own event! Here are the steps you need to take to make it align with your own branding.

1. Open the **Resources/Strings/Strings.resx** file and replace all texts with what you want them to be. You at least want to change the app name from "My Conference" to be your own event name. If there are any additional resx files either remove those if you don't want translations, or change them accordingly.
1. TBD

## Acknowledgements

This idea came from the [Xamarin pre-build conference app](https://github.com/xamarinhq/app-conference) from many years ago, which I absolutely loved!

Now with all the conferences using Sessionize, I thought it might be a good idea to rebuild this app, now with .NET MAUI and powered by Sessionize!

As a starting point I took some inspiration from James who started to build a [version of this](https://github.com/jamesmontemagno/app-myconference).
